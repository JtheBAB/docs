### Breaking Changes since last release

 - If **DisableLegacyMfa** setting in ``config.json`` is set to ``true`` and multi-factor authentication is enabled, ensure your users have upgraded to mobile app version 1.17 or later. Otherwise, users who have MFA enabled may not be able to log in successfully. See [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html) for more details.
 - The public IP of the Mattermost application server is considered a reserved IP for additional security hardening in the context of untrusted external requests such as Open Graph metadata, webhooks or slash commands. See [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html) for more details.

**IMPORTANT:** If you upgrade from another release than 5.8, please read the [Important Upgrade Notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html).
